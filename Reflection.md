# Reflection

Creating this lab provided a safe way to learn how cyberattacks and defenses work in practice. Executing the Samba exploit and then reviewing Snort alerts showed how attacker actions translate into observable signals and detections on the network.

Key points noted in the report:
- Simulating a small network with pfSense, Snort, a vulnerable target, and an attacker VM clarified how segmentation and security tools work together.
- The exercise demonstrated that IDS/IPS can reveal port scans, exploitation attempts, and other malicious activity for investigation.
