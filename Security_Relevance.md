# Security Relevance

Modern enterprise networks face a continuous stream of threats ranging from automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning to targeted exploitation attempts. As part of this lab environment, the integration of an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) — specifically Snort — into the network perimeter illustrates how layered security controls function as part of a mature defense-in-depth strategy.

Snort operates as a network-based IDS/IPS, passively inspecting packets and analyzing them against a dynamic set of signatures and heuristics. When deployed at the firewall layer (pfSense), it monitors traffic traversing critical network segments — particularly the communication between the attacker machine (Kali Linux) and the vulnerable target (Metasploitable 2) — and identifies anomalous or malicious activity in real time.

This implementation highlights the fundamental security value of IDS/IPS technologies: they bridge the gap between network visibility and proactive defense. Detection provides visibility into reconnaissance and exploitation attempts, while prevention capabilities allow for real-time disruption of attacks before they achieve persistence or cause operational impact.

## Threat Detection and Analysis Workflow

During the exploitation phase of the lab, Snort generated alerts corresponding to Samba exploitation attempts (e.g., CVE-2007-2447) initiated from the attacker machine. These alerts, visible in the pfSense web interface, provided actionable intelligence that would enable a security operations center (SOC) to initiate incident response procedures.

The workflow demonstrated here mirrors real-world network defense practices:

1. **Traffic Inspection:** Snort continuously inspects network traffic on defined interfaces, logging and flagging any anomalies.
2. **Threat Correlation:** Detected signatures (e.g., exploit payloads, reconnaissance scans, brute-force attempts) are correlated with known threat patterns.
3. **Alerting and Response:** Security teams can act on Snort’s detections — either manually or through automated orchestration — to contain and mitigate threats.
4. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Alerts are analyzed for root cause and indicators of compromise (IOCs), informing future defensive strategies.

This approach validates the deployment of intrusion detection technologies while emphasizing their role in supporting the broader cybersecurity lifecycle — from detection and containment to recovery and continuous improvement.

## IDS vs. IPS: Operational Impact

While IDS and IPS technologies share a common detection foundation, their operational roles differ significantly:

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** Provides visibility into network activity, flagging potential threats without altering traffic flow. This is essential for environments where uninterrupted traffic is a priority, and human analysts triage alerts for further action.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** Extends IDS capabilities by actively blocking or modifying malicious traffic in real time. Deployed inline, IPS technologies reduce the attack surface by preventing exploit delivery and command-and-control communication.

In enterprise environments, combining IDS and IPS within a single platform — as demonstrated with Snort on pfSense — ensures that threats are not only detected but also contained before they can escalate into breaches or service disruptions.

## Security Architecture Significance

The architecture implemented in this lab reflects industry best practices for securing segmented networks. By placing a firewall (pfSense) at the perimeter and deploying Snort as an IDS/IPS component, the environment emulates the type of layered security posture recommended by frameworks such as NIST CSF and the MITRE ATT&CK model.

Moreover, the simulated exploitation of a deliberately vulnerable host (Metasploitable 2) by a dedicated attack platform (Kali Linux) demonstrates how visibility, segmentation, and automated response combine to significantly reduce dwell time — the period between initial compromise and detection — a key metric in modern cybersecurity resilience strategies.
